## General Information

With this REST API you can get, post, update and delete data. To make this actions, you need to register and login to get a valid token. You need to send that token in your request header to get/post data.

I made this REST API to simulate an Ice Cream Shop. It is possible add/edit/delete ice cream flavours and every flavour can have photos associated. This API is made to be consumed by a backoffice frontend.

## Setup
To run this Rest API, you need to download and unzip the code. If you donÂ´t have NodeJS, you need to [install it first](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Open a terminal command in API folder and run the follow command (to install all dependencies):
```
npm i
```

After you run this command to install all dependencies, you should run the follow command:
```
npm start
```
Now you have a local server running which allow you test the API.

## Usage

After you start the API, i recommend you to test it first.

To test this API, i recommend that you install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download). I use Insomnia but feel free to use whatever you want.
